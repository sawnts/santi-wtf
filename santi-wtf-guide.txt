SANTI.WTF - THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE
=================================

Alright so here's the deal with your site.

WHAT IT IS
----------
A personal website that looks like Windows 98. Everything runs in the browser - no backend, no database (except Firebase for the guestbook), no complicated stuff. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one big index.html file.


THE FEATURES
------------

Desktop Icons:
- Newsletter - opens subscribe dialog
- Internet Explorer - your blog
- Guestbook - Firebase-powered, people can leave messages
- Winamp - music player with your tunes
- Applications folder - Flow Garden, Sticky Notes

The IE Window:
- Acts like a mini browser inside your site
- Has working back/forward/refresh buttons
- Posts have their own URLs now (shareable links like santi.wtf/#posts/post-name.html)

Winamp:
- Plays songs from /vibes folder (Esperanza.mp3, Community.mp3)
- Has a playlist, visualizer, volume control
- Music stops when you close the window

Guestbook:
- Real-time comments via Firebase
- Admin mode: triple-click the title bar, password is "wtf123"
- Lets you delete spam

Subscribe Dialogs (3 ways to capture emails):
- Shut Down easter egg (Start menu → Shut Down)
- Clippy assistant (pops up after 15 seconds, once per session)
- Newsletter desktop icon
All three open the same Beehiiv form, just with different messaging.


THE FILES
---------
/index.html - the main site, everything lives here
/posts/ - blog posts go here
/icons/ - Windows 98 icons
/vibes/ - music files
/applications/ - Flow Garden, Sticky Notes


HOW TO PUBLISH A NEW POST
-------------------------
1. Write in Evernote like you normally do
2. Paste the text to Claude
3. Claude creates the HTML and deploys it
4. Done. Takes like 30 seconds.

That's it. No formatting, no code, no dragging files around.


HOW DEPLOYMENT WORKS
--------------------
Your site is on GitHub (github.com/sawnts/santi-wtf) and Netlify auto-deploys whenever you push changes.

The magic commands:
  git add .
  git commit -m "what you changed"
  git push

Or just ask Claude to deploy for you.


IMPORTANT LINKS
---------------
- Live site: https://santi.wtf
- Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com (manage deploys, domain)
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/sawnts/santi-wtf (your code backup)
- Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com (guestbook data)
- Beehiiv: wherever you manage your newsletter


PASSWORDS & SECRETS
-------------------
- Guestbook admin mode: triple-click title bar, password "wtf123"
- Firebase config is in index.html (not secret, just identifies your project)


THINGS TO REMEMBER
------------------
- Always test locally first: python3 -m http.server 8080, then open localhost:8080
- The Beehiiv form won't load if you open index.html directly as a file (needs a server)
- Posts need to be added to both homeContent AND archiveContent in index.html
- If VS Code shows old code, close the file without saving and reopen it


IF SOMETHING BREAKS
-------------------
- Check Netlify dashboard for deploy errors
- git status shows what's changed
- You can always roll back on Netlify (click any previous deploy → "Publish deploy")


That's pretty much it. You've got a sick Windows 98 site that deploys automatically and you can publish posts just by pasting text. Not bad for someone who thought their MySpace HTML skills would be enough.

Cheers.
