<h1>building this garden</h1>
<p>this is a digital garden — a place for ideas to grow over time. here&#39;s how it works.</p>
<h2>first, why a garden?</h2>
<p>blogs are streams — newest first, then forgotten. gardens are different. notes evolve. old ideas connect to new ones. the structure grows organically.</p>
<p>it&#39;s less about <em>publishing</em> and more about <em>thinking in public</em>.</p>
<p>i originally got the idea to create a digital garden after stumbling into andy matuschak&#39;s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_noteshttps://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes">working notes</a> a couple years back.</p>
<p>but i digress...</p>
<h2>the basics</h2>
<p>notes live as simple text files on my computer. i write them in <a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian</a>, a note-taking app. when i&#39;m ready to share, a simple script converts them to web pages (more on the tech at the end).</p>
<h2>how ideas connect</h2>
<p><a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/linking is thinking">linking is thinking</a>. in my notes, i can link to other notes using double brackets.</p>
<p> <em>backlinks</em> are also crucial. when note A links to note B, note B automatically knows about it and shows &quot;what links here&quot; at the bottom. this linking matters because:</p>
<ul>
<li>ideas don&#39;t exist in isolation — they gain meaning through connections</li>
<li>i can stumble upon relationships i forgot about</li>
<li>i can trace how concepts relate to each other</li>
</ul>
<p>it&#39;s like a personal wikipedia, but messier and a bit more honest.</p>
<h2>how ideas evolve</h2>
<p>not all ideas in the garden are equal.</p>
<ul>
<li>🌱 <strong>seedling</strong> — rough thoughts, barely formed</li>
<li>🌿 <strong>growing</strong> — taking shape, needs tending</li>
<li>🌲 <strong>evergreen</strong> — solid, stable ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>this helps me (and you) know what&#39;s half-baked vs well-developed.</p>
<h2>the tech behind the garden</h2>
<p>there are tools out there like obsidian publish (paid) and some free alternatives that allow you to publish your idea gardens in just a few clicks, but, because i wanted a seamless integration between my garden and personal website, i built it from scratch to keep the vibes intact. it&#39;s actually simpler than it looks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>markdown files</strong> — plain text with light formatting</li>
<li><strong>frontmatter</strong> — metadata at the top (title, tags, dates)</li>
<li><strong>build script</strong> — converts markdown to html, extracts links</li>
<li><strong>static hosting</strong> — no database, just files on github</li>
</ol>
<p>the whole thing runs in your browser. no accounts, no tracking, no nonsense, no fees.</p>
