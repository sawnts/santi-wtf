<h1>habit tracker</h1>
<p>a garden grows one day at a time.</p>
<h2>why</h2>
<p>i don&#39;t track habits to optimize myself. i track them to stay honest. it&#39;s easy to think you&#39;re doing the work when you&#39;re not. the calendar doesn&#39;t lie. consistency is what makes <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/power-of-writing-online">writing online</a> and <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="3. doing/digital-garden">tending a garden</a> work.</p>
<p>these six things keep me grounded: stillness, rest, movement, learning, reflection, and play. when i do them consistently, everything else falls into place. when i don&#39;t, it&#39;s easy to notice.</p>
