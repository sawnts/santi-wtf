<p>good links are like good friendships — they need shared context to mean something.</p>
<p>linking two notes because they both mention &quot;creativity&quot; is shallow. no different than introducing two people because they live in new york. technically true, but practically useless.</p>
<p>effective connections happen when ideas speak to each other. when one note challenges, extends, or illuminates another. when the link itself carries meaning.</p>
<p>ask: why does this connection matter? if you can&#39;t answer, the link is noise.</p>
<p>the best connections surprise you. they reveal relationships you didn&#39;t see when you wrote the notes. that&#39;s when the system starts thinking with you.</p>
