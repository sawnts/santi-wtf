<p>good ideas don&#39;t live in isolation. they live in relationship.</p>
<p><a href="integration">linking notes</a> is the act of drawing explicit connections between ideas. not filing — connecting. <strong>a note isn&#39;t valuable because it&#39;s stored somewhere fancy</strong>. it&#39;s valuable because it touches other notes in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>your digital garden isn&#39;t a filing cabinet. it&#39;s a web. the nodes are ideas, the edges are links, and the structure is your thinking visualized.</p>
<h2>why</h2>
<p>creativity is combinatorial. new ideas emerge from the cross-pollination of existing ones. <strong>the more connections you make, the more surface area for insight.</strong></p>
<p>linking also forces clarity. you can&#39;t connect an idea you don&#39;t understand. the act of asking &quot;what does this relate to?&quot; sharpens the thought.</p>
<p>over time, your web becomes a thinking partner. you stop searching for ideas and start traversing them. paths emerge that you didn&#39;t plan. that&#39;s the payoff.</p>
<h2>how</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>link as you write</strong> — don&#39;t wait. when a related idea comes to mind, link it immediately.</li>
<li><strong>link to ideas, not categories</strong> — <code><span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">perfectionism kills creativity 🔒</span></code> beats <code><span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">creativity 🔒</span></code>.</li>
<li><strong>link bidirectionally</strong> — if A relates to B, make sure you can find A from B.</li>
<li><strong>link with intention</strong> — ask why the connection matters. <span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">_effective connections 🔒</span></li>
<li><strong>revisit and relink</strong> — your best connections come from <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/rereading old notes">rereading old notes</a>with new context.</li>
</ol>
<p>the goal isn&#39;t to link everything. it&#39;s to link meaningfully. quality over quantity. every link should earn its place.</p>
