<h1>the map is not the territory</h1>
<p>a mental model from Alfred Korzybski (1931): our representations of reality — maps, models, frameworks, other people&#39;s systems — are always abstractions, never the thing itself.</p>
<h2>the idea</h2>
<p>maps are useful. they help us navigate. but they leave things out. they simplify. they were drawn by someone else, for their purposes, at a specific time.</p>
<p>the territory is what&#39;s actually there. messy, complex, alive.</p>
<p><strong>the danger:</strong> confusing the map for the territory. following someone else&#39;s system as if it <em>is</em> the path, rather than <em>a</em> path.</p>
<h2>process is personal</h2>
<p>this is why <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="2. being/2026 lessons">process is personal</a>. someone else&#39;s productivity system, creative routine, or life philosophy is their map — drawn from their experience, their brain, their context.</p>
<p>look for inspiration, not instructions.</p>
<p>their map might reveal terrain you hadn&#39;t considered. it might suggest routes worth exploring. but you still have to walk the territory yourself. you still have to do the work.</p>
<p>the only way out is through.</p>
