<h1>thinking in public</h1>
<p>sharing ideas before they&#39;re finished.</p>
<p>this is what a <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="3. doing/digital-garden">digital-garden</a> is for. not polished essays, but thoughts in progress. seedlings alongside evergreens.</p>
<h2>why do it</h2>
<p><strong>accountability</strong> — when ideas are public, you have to tend them. the garden creates pressure to develop your thinking.</p>
<p><strong>feedback</strong> — other people see things you miss. sometimes a stranger&#39;s comment unlocks a stuck idea.</p>
<p><strong>connection</strong> — you find your people by showing your work. the weird specific thing you&#39;re into? someone else is too.</p>
<p><strong>compounding</strong> — ideas build on ideas. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/linking is thinking">linking is thinking</a>. a public archive of your thinking becomes a resource you can draw from forever.</p>
<h2>the fear</h2>
<p>what if it&#39;s wrong? what if it&#39;s dumb? what if someone disagrees?</p>
<p>that&#39;s the point. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/the map is not the territory">the map is not the territory</a> — your ideas are maps, not truth. getting them out of your head and into the world is how you refine them.</p>
<p>the <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="2. being/soft guy era">soft guy era</a> question: what if you just... didn&#39;t perform? what if you just shared what you&#39;re thinking, without pressure to be right?</p>
