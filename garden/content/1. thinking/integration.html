<h1>integration</h1>
<p>the best ideas often come from combining concepts that don&#39;t obviously belong together. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="4. loving/david ogilvy">ogilvy</a> called this &quot;creative cross-pollination.&quot;</p>
<h2>the opposite of splitting</h2>
<p>while <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/splitting">splitting</a> is about breaking things down to understand them, integration is about reassembling them in new ways. both skills are essential.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="4. loving/miles davis">miles davis</a> didn&#39;t just play jazz — he integrated classical harmonies, rock rhythms, and electronic textures. the result was something entirely new.</p>
<h2>how to practice integration</h2>
<ul>
<li>read widely outside your field</li>
<li>look for structural similarities between different domains</li>
<li>ask &quot;what would x think about y?&quot;</li>
<li>combine tools and techniques from unrelated disciplines</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;creativity is just connecting things. when you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&#39;t really do it, they just saw something.&quot; — steve jobs</p>
