<h1>splitting</h1>
<p>before you can understand something, you often need to break it apart. this is splitting — the analytical complement to <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/integration">integration</a>.</p>
<h2>when to split</h2>
<p>splitting is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>a problem feels overwhelming</li>
<li>you can&#39;t identify the root cause</li>
<li>you need to explain something complex</li>
<li>you want to improve a process</li>
</ul>
<h2>techniques</h2>
<p><strong>mece (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)</strong> — divide things into categories that don&#39;t overlap but cover everything.</p>
<p><strong>first principles</strong> — break down to fundamental truths and rebuild from there.</p>
<p><strong>5 whys</strong> — keep asking &quot;why&quot; to drill down to root causes.</p>
<h2>the danger</h2>
<p>pure analysis can miss emergent properties. a song is more than the sum of its notes. after splitting, remember to step back and see the whole again.</p>
