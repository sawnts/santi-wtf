<p>your past self had ideas your current self forgot. rereading is how you bring them back — under a new light, with fresh eyes, and a heavy dose of curiosity.</p>
<h2>why do it?</h2>
<p>notes decay without attention. an idea captured six months ago might be exactly what you need today, but you won&#39;t find it if you&#39;re only looking forward.</p>
<p>rereading also deepens understanding. you&#39;re not the same person who wrote that note. new experiences, new context, new connections. what seemed obvious then might click differently now. what felt incomplete might suddenly have an ending. this was my experience after reading <span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">five lessons on the creative life 🔒</span> over a year after writing it. it somehow inspired this gardening project</p>
<p>serendipity happens not by accident, but by showing up, constantly, over a long enough timeline.</p>
<h2>how i do it</h2>
<p><strong>weekly:</strong> during my weekly review, i open 3-5 random notes. read them. ask: does this connect to anything i&#39;m working on? any new links to add?</p>
<p><strong>monthly:</strong> i pick a folder or tag and skim through it. look for orphans — notes with no backlinks. i either connect them or let them go (unless they&#39;re haunting).</p>
<p><strong>when stuck:</strong> before starting something new, i search through my garden for related ideas. you never know. your best material might already exist.</p>
<p>you can also read one random note per day. read it and link it, if it tickles you.</p>
<p>and remember: consistency beats intensity.</p>
