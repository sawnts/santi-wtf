<h1>the power of writing online</h1>
<p>the person who can string together words that evoke emotion, facilitate insight, and entertain readers has a huge competitive advantage in today&#39;s digital world. writing is the simplest, most impactful way to share ideas. it&#39;s persuasion, entertainment, and connection at scale.</p>
<p>but writing online is more than mere self-expression. it&#39;s self-discovery. </p>
<p>here are 10 damn good reasons why curious, creative, and ambitious people should be writing online:</p>
<p><strong>1. writing online has zero barriers.</strong> it&#39;s virtually free — no fancy gear or software required. it&#39;s portable — you can publish from your phone, draft on a napkin, or write on any device. you get ultimate creative freedom without the startup costs.</p>
<p><strong>2. writing online connects.</strong> it <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/linking is thinking">links your thinking</a> with others&#39;, allowing your thoughts to become a part of a global web of ideas. it also makes your ideas discoverable, which helps you connect with like-minded people — friends, colleagues, business partners, clients, employers. it connects you with people from your future.</p>
<p><strong>3. writing online is perfect for introverts looking to build a brand or establish authority.</strong> you don&#39;t have to show your face or talk in front of a camera. or, if you&#39;re hot like me, it&#39;s a way to ensure people like you for your ideas, not your looks ;)</p>
<p><strong>4. writing helps you think better.</strong> <span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">writing is thinking on paper 🔒</span>. when you write, you create the distance you need to think clearly about an argument or what you think you know. writing forces you to slow down and think deeply. you don&#39;t know what you think until you write it down. that&#39;s why <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/evergreen notes are for thinking">evergreen notes</a> work — they&#39;re not for publishing, they&#39;re for understanding.</p>
<p><strong>5. writing builds trust.</strong> writing online, especially through an owned channel like email or a blog, helps you you nurture genuine relationships with your readers. email especially. that means they trust you enough to let you in their inbox. they&#39;re inviting you over.</p>
<p><strong>6. writing online is a perfect feedback loop.</strong> online writers get instant feedback in the form of shares and replies. these fast feedback loops are powerful ways to accelerate your learning (and improve your writing).</p>
<p><strong>7. writing is a skill multiplier.</strong> writing sharpens your thinking and accelerates your learning. it can also help you craft better emails, presentations, scripts while building credibility and expertise.</p>
<p><strong>8. writing compounds.</strong> your tiktoks, reels, and tweets live very short lives. they&#39;re quickly forgotten. writing online, on an owned platform, allows your work to work for you for years to come. this is why i built a <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="3. doing/digital-garden">digital garden</a> instead of a blog — ideas grow and connect over time.</p>
<p><strong>9. writing creates focus in a distracted world.</strong> we&#39;ve traded deep thinking for doom-scrolling. writing gives you the space you need to play with ideas, wrestle with problems, and sit with them long enough to actually understand what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p><strong>10. writing is good for your mental health and personal development.</strong> writing reveals who you are. the best writing travels lightly. it doesn&#39;t pack fluff. similarly, writing can help you strip away parts of you that aren&#39;t you or no longer serve you. it can also help you uncover parts of yourself you didn&#39;t know existed and heal forgotten wounds.</p>

<p>publishing a solid piece of writing can change your life because the internet rewards people who think well. each post is an advertisement for the kinds of people and opportunities you want to attract. writing (and sharing it) is a lovely hobby. by jotting down your ideas and hitting publish, you sharpen your mind, heal your soul, and create opportunities for yourself. what other creative act offers a better return on investment?</p>
<p>it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a writer, designer, wood worker, ceramicist, or a freaking cook. if you&#39;re not writing online, you&#39;re leaving money on the table and a whole lot more.</p>
