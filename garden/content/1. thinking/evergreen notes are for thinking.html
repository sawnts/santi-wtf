<p>evergreen notes aren&#39;t content. they&#39;re tools for thought.</p>
<p>you don&#39;t write them to publish. you write them to understand. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/linking is thinking">to connect ideas</a>. to build a web of knowledge you can traverse, wrestle with, and expand.</p>
<p>the goal isn&#39;t a polished output — it&#39;s clarity. capture the idea in its purest form, link it to related concepts, and <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/making effective connections">let the connections do the work.</a></p>
