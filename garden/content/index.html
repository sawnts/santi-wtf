<h1>welcome to my garden.</h1>
<h2>shoes off, please.</h2>
<p>i built this site because i miss the internet. the one before the apps. i miss the weird little corners of the web where people shared their thoughts, art, and creativity freely. the internet before social media algorithms.</p>
<p>i miss that internet.</p>
<p>so i made a little corner of my own to share my thoughts, feelings, and projects. away from all the noise. away from algorithms, gurus, and ads. just me, my words, and now, you.</p>
<p><strong>a little bit about me:</strong> i&#39;m santi — i study the greatest creative minds, run a <a href="https://mail.0ffbrand.com">weekly letter</a> about them, and spend my days slinging software. when i&#39;m not working, you&#39;ll find me reading, <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/power-of-writing-online">writing</a>, or <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/sawnts">pushing pawns</a>.</p>
