<h1>2026 lessons</h1>
<p>a running list of things i&#39;m learning this year. updated as life teaches me.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>going to bed early is just sleeping in on the front end.</strong> it&#39;s a proactive win, not a loss of time.</p>
<p><strong>process is personal.</strong> don&#39;t confuse someone else&#39;s map for the territory. look for inspiration, not instructions. the only way out is through the work. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/the map is not the territory">the map is not the territory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>on personal knowledge management:</strong> no loose quotes. no digital hoarding. if i keep it, i must define <em>why</em> it matters and <em>where</em> it fits. (see: <span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">why i use obsidian 🔒</span>).</p>
<p><strong>if you&#39;re not writing, you&#39;re not thinking.</strong> writing forces you to face yourself because it exposes the flaws of your thinking. (see: <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/power-of-writing-online">the power of writing online</a>).</p>
<p><strong>you want your goals to be perfect and big and doable but you can only pick two.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>laziness makes the most exciting and beautiful boring and dull.</strong></p>
<p><strong>creativity is a battle</strong> where the ego wants to keep you &quot;safe&quot; in captivity, while the soul wants you to be free.</p>
<p><strong>tool-switching is a drug.</strong> it creates the illusion of progress without the output.</p>
<p><strong>you can&#39;t experience safety without first practicing courage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>the healing we do independently is preparation for the healing we do in relationship.</strong> it&#39;s easy to be &quot;healed&quot; in isolation. the real test comes when you allow yourself to be loved and seen.</p>
<p><strong>routine isn&#39;t the only path to peace.</strong> your peace comes from <em>being</em>, not optimizing.</p>
<p><strong>movement is medicine for the body. meditation is medicine for the mind. writing is medicine for the soul.</strong></p>
