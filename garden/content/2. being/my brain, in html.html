<h1>my brain, in html</h1>
<p>the internet used to feel like exploring someone&#39;s brain.</p>
<p>not their brand. not their feed. their actual brain — laid out in html, links intentionally arranged, background colors carefully picked. you&#39;d stumble onto someone&#39;s homepage and feel like you&#39;d found something truly special.</p>
<p>that internet is gone. i want it back.</p>
<h2>why i built this garden</h2>
<p>a <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="3. doing/digital-garden">digital garden</a> is a collection of notes that grow over time. unlike a blog, where posts are polished and sorted by date, a garden is always evolving. ideas connect to each other. old thoughts get updated when new context arrives. nothing is really ever &quot;done.&quot;</p>
<p>it&#39;s less about publishing and more about <span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">thinking in public 🔒</span>.</p>
<p>that scares me. sharing half-formed thoughts feels vulnerable in a way that polished essays don&#39;t. what if it&#39;s wrong? what if it&#39;s dumb? what if someone reads it and realizes i&#39;m as lost as anyone?</p>
<p>but i think that&#39;s the point.</p>
<p>most of what i write never sees the light of day. it sits in folders, collecting dust, slowly becoming irrelevant. this garden is my attempt to change that — to create pressure to develop my thinking, and maybe find people who are into the same weird shit i am.</p>
