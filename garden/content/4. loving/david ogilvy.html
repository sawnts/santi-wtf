<h1>david ogilvy</h1>
<p>the father of advertising. insisted on research before creativity.</p>
<p>chef at the hotel majestic in paris, door-to-door stove salesman, gallup researcher, british intelligence officer, farmer — all before founding an ad agency at 38. He credited this eclectic background with giving him a deeper understanding of both products and consumers.  no wonder he sold billions of dollars for some of the biggest brands in the world with his damn pen.</p>
<p>a visionary with a deep understanding of <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="1. thinking/integration">integration</a>. in an interview, he said: &quot;i don&#39;t think the world should be divided into creative people and the others... i think copywriters should become, have a few years as an account executive, and then you can move account executives into copy so that they become generalists.&quot; </p>
