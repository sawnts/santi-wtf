<h2>ogilvy&#39;s letter</h2>
<p><em>dear mr. calt:</em></p>
<p><em>on march 22nd you wrote to me asking for some notes on my work habits as a copywriter. they are appalling, as you are about to see:</em></p>
<p><em>i have never written an advertisement in the office. too many interruptions. i do all my writing at home.</em></p>
<p><em>1. i spend a long time studying the precedents. i look at every advertisement which has appeared for competing products during the past 20 years.</em></p>
<p><em>2. i am helpless without research material—and the more &quot;motivational&quot; the better.</em></p>
<p><em>3. i write out a definition of the problem and a statement of the purpose which i wish the campaign to achieve. then i go no further until the statement and its principles have been accepted by the client.</em></p>
<p><em>4. before actually writing the copy, i write down every conceivable fact and selling idea. then i get them organized and relate them to research and the copy platform.</em></p>
<p><em>5. then i write the headline. as a matter of fact i try to write 20 alternative headlines for every advertisement. and i never select the final headline without asking the opinion of other people in the agency. in some cases i seek the help of the research department and get them to do a split-run on a battery of headlines.</em></p>
<p><em>6. at this point i can no longer postpone the actual copy. so i go home and sit down at my desk. i find myself entirely without ideas. i get bad-tempered. if my wife comes into the room i growl at her. (this has gotten worse since i gave up smoking.)</em></p>
<p><em>7. i am terrified of producing a lousy advertisement. this causes me to throw away the first 20 attempts.</em></p>
<p><em>8. if all else fails, i drink half a bottle of rum and play a handel oratorio on the gramophone. this generally produces an uncontrollable gush of copy.</em></p>
<p><em>9. the next morning i get up early and edit the gush.</em></p>
<p><em>10. then i take the train to new york and my secretary types a draft. (i cannot type, which is very inconvenient.)</em></p>
<p><em>11. i am a lousy copywriter, but i am a good editor. so i go to work editing my own draft. after four or five editings, it looks good enough to show to the client. if the client changes the copy, i get angry—because i took a lot of trouble writing it, and what i wrote i wrote on purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>altogether it is a slow and laborious business. i understand that some copywriters have much greater facility.</em></p>
<p><em>yours sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em>d.o.</em></p>
<h2>brain food</h2>
<p>heavy research before writing. he sharpens his axe. writes 20 headlines before picking one. terror and rum and handel. in writing, editing is the real skill.</p>
