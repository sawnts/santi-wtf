<p>i&#39;ve been <a href="https://mail.0ffbrand.com/p/the-future-of-social-media-is-email">yapping nonstop</a> about the benefits of building your email list — ownership, connection, money — but there&#39;s so much more writing online can do for you. it can change you.</p>
<h2>the power of writing online</h2>
<p>the person who can string together words that evoke emotion, facilitate insight, and entertain readers has a huge competitive advantage in today&#39;s digital world. writing is the simplest, most impactful way to share ideas. it&#39;s persuasion, entertainment, and connection at scale.</p>
<p>but writing online is more than self-expression. it&#39;s self-discovery.</p>
<p>if you haven&#39;t already, here are 10 damn good reasons why you should start writing online today.</p>
<p><strong>1. writing online has zero barriers.</strong> it&#39;s virtually free—no fancy gear or software required. it&#39;s portable—you can publish from your phone, draft on a napkin, or write on any device. you get ultimate creative freedom without the startup costs.</p>
<p><strong>2. writing online connects.</strong> it links your thinking with others&#39;, allowing your thoughts to become a part of a global conversation. it also makes your ideas discoverable, helping you connect with like-minded people — friends, colleagues, business partners, clients, employers. where social platforms connect you with people from your past, writing online connects you with people from your future.</p>
<p><strong>3. writing online is perfect for introverts looking to build a brand or establish authority.</strong> you don&#39;t have to show your face or talk in front of a camera. or, if you&#39;re hot like me, it&#39;s a way to ensure people like you for your ideas, not your looks.</p>
<p><strong>4. writing helps you think better.</strong> writing is thinking on paper. when you write, you create the distance you need to think clearly about an argument or what you think you know. writing forces you to slow down and think deeply. you don&#39;t know what you think until you write it down.</p>
<p><strong>5. build a direct connection with your audience.</strong> if you&#39;re building an audience by simply posting on social media, you&#39;re engaging in risky business. social media algorithms can be unpredictable, and you&#39;re always at the mercy of the platform. writing online, through a newsletter or a blog, helps you slice through the noise and lets you nurture a genuine relationship with your readers. you have a direct line to them.</p>
<p><strong>6. writing online is a perfect feedback loop.</strong> online writers get instant feedback in the form of shares and replies. these fast feedback loops are powerful ways to accelerate your learning (and improve your writing).</p>
<p><strong>7. writing is a skill multiplier.</strong> writing sharpens your thinking and accelerates your learning. it can also help you craft better emails, presentations, scripts. not to mention, it builds credibility and expertise.</p>
<p><strong>8. writing compounds.</strong> your tiktoks, reels, and tweets live short lives. they&#39;re quickly forgotten. writing online, on an owned platform, allows your work to work for you for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>9. writing creates focus in a distracted world.</strong> we&#39;ve traded deep thinking for doom-scrolling. writing gives you the time and space you need to play with ideas, wrestle with problems, and sit with them long enough to actually understand what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p><strong>10. writing is good for your mental health and personal development.</strong> writing reveals who you are. the secret to good writing is to strip each sentence to its essence. similarly, writing can help you strip away parts of you that aren&#39;t you or no longer serve you. it can also help you uncover parts of yourself you didn&#39;t know existed, heal invisible wounds, and accelerate your healing and growth.</p>

<p>publishing a solid piece of writing can change your life because the internet rewards people who think well. each post is an advertisement for the kinds of people and opportunities you want to attract. think about it. by jotting down your ideas and hitting publish, you build your network, improve your thinking, and create opportunities for yourself. name another creative act that offers a better return on investment. i&#39;ll wait.</p>
<p>writing is good, but writing online is better. it&#39;s like having people over. you have to clean and make sure you have enough food, snacks, and drinks for everyone to feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. writing online is no different. you have to write and re-write to make sure your ideas are clear and concise. this process of crafting and refining not only makes you a better writer, but it encourages deeper inquiry, self-reflection, and ultimately, personal growth.</p>
<p>it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a writer, designer, wood worker, ceramicist, or a freaking cook. if you&#39;re not taking advantage of the powers online writing provides, you&#39;re not just leaving money on the table and missing out on community, you&#39;re holding yourself back from reaching new personal, spiritual, and creative heights.</p>
