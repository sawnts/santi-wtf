    <h1>The Power of Writing Online</h1>

    <p>I've been yapping nonstop about the financial and strategic benefits of email, but very little about the power of publishing your writing on a consistent basis.</p>

    <p>In an era of TikToks, Reels, and AI slop, you may feel like text-based content is dead, but that couldn't be further from the truth. And even if it were true, writing online is still one of the best uses of your intellectual, emotional, and creative energy.</p>

    <h2>The power of writing online</h2>

    <p>The person who can string together words that evoke emotion, facilitate insight, and entertain readers has a huge competitive advantage in today's digital world for writing is the simplest yet most impactful way to share ideas. It is persuasion at scale. But writing is more than just a tool for sharing ideas. It's also a powerful tool for generating them — the more you write, the more ideas you produce.</p>

    <p>And we're just scratching the surface here.</p>

    <p>If you're thinking about getting started or are experiencing self-doubt, here are 10 damn good reasons why you should start writing online today.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Writing online is virtually free.</strong> You don't need to spend a ton of money on fancy gear or software. You don't even need a computer. You can start publishing from your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing is portable.</strong> You can literally write anywhere — on your phone, laptop, or even a napkin. Writing gives you the ultimate creative freedom.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing online connects.</strong> It links your thinking with others', allowing your thoughts to become a part of the world wide web of ideas. It also makes your ideas discoverable, helping you connect with like-minded people — friends, colleagues, business partners, clients, employers. Where social platforms connect you with people from your past, writing online connects you with people from your future.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing online is perfect for introverts</strong> looking to build a brand or establish authority. You don't have to show your face or talk in front of a camera. Or if you're hot like me, it's a way to make sure people like you for your ideas, not your looks.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing helps you think better.</strong> Writing is thinking on paper. When you write you create the distance you need to think clearly about an argument or what you think you know. Writing forces you to slow down and think deeply. You don't know what you know until you write about it.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a direct connection with your audience.</strong> If you're building an audience by simply posting on social media, you're engaging in risky business. Social media algorithms can be unpredictable, and you're always at the mercy of the platform. Writing online, through a newsletter or a blog, helps you slice through the noise and lets you nurture a genuine relationship with your readers. You have a direct line to them, ensuring your message reaches them consistently.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing online is a perfect feedback loop.</strong> Online writers are rewarded with instant feedback in the form of shares and replies. These fast feedback loops are powerful ways to accelerate your learning (and improve your writing).</li>
        <li><strong>Writing is a skill multiplier.</strong> Like I mentioned before, writing helps you think and learn better. It can also help you craft better emails, presentations, scripts. Not to mention, it builds credibility and expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing creates focus in a distracted world.</strong> In an era of shortened attention spans, we've gone from reasoned thinkers to reactive thinkers. Writing gives you the time and space you need to play with ideas, think about your problems, and engage with them long enough to develop a deeper understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing is good for your mental health and personal development.</strong> Writing is more than a tool for self-expression; it's also a tool for self-discovery. The secret to good writing is to strip each sentence to its essence. Similarly, writing can help you strip away parts of you that aren't you or no longer serve you. It can also help you uncover parts of yourself you didn't know existed, heal invisible wounds, and accelerate your healing and growth.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>"If you wish you would take something more seriously, do it publicly… Social pressure forces you to up your game." — James Clear</blockquote>

    <p>Publishing a solid piece of writing can change your life because the internet rewards people who think well. Each post is an advertisement for the kinds of people and opportunities you want to attract. Think about it. By jotting down your ideas and hitting publish, you can build your network, improve your thinking, and create opportunities for yourself. Name another creative act that offers a better return on investment. I'll wait.</p>

    <p>Writing is good, but writing online is better. It's like having people over. You have to clean and make sure you have enough food, snacks, and drinks for everyone to feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. Writing online is no different. You have to write and re-write to make sure your ideas are clear and concise and if writing is thinking, then rewriting is rethinking. This process of crafting and refining not only makes you a better writer, but it encourages deeper inquiry, self-reflection, and ultimately, personal growth.</p>

    <p>In 2026, I plan on writing and publishing more. 0ffbrand will continue to serve as the hub for timeless principles for the modern creative, exploring the intersection of creativity, business, and philosophy. But I will also be sharing more personal reflections and ideas that are outside the scope of this weekly letter on my personal site, which I've started coding myself — a fun personal project for the first stretch of 2026. It's far from ready but I'll be sharing updates as this project begins to take shape.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter if you're a writer, designer, wood worker, ceramicist, or a freaking cook. If you're not taking advantage of the powers online writing provides, you're not just leaving money on the table, you're holding yourself back from reaching new personal, spiritual, and creative heights.</p>
