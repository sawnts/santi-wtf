    <h1>pls ignore</h1>

    <p>this is just a test post.</p>

    <p>pls ignore this because it's just me figuring out how this site works and what not.</p>

    <p>i might've bitten more than i can chew by trying to build a site from scratch. i thought my html and css knowledge from my myspace days and my high school web design class would be enough, but it turns out it's not that simple. i am humbled.</p>

    <p>fuck it though. here we are. we doing it.</p>

    <p>if you're still reading this, i'm sorry i wasted your time. i hope you come back when i have it a bit more dialed in.</p>

    <p>talk soon.</p>
