<h1>creative cross-pollination</h1>
<p>borrowing ideas from one field and applying them in another.</p>
<p>this is <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="integration">integration</a> in practice. the best ideas often come from collisions between domains that don&#39;t usually touch.</p>
<h2>examples</h2>
<p><strong><a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="david-ogilvy">david ogilvy</a></strong> — chef, salesman, spy, farmer, then ad man. each career fed the next. he understood products because he sold stoves door-to-door. he understood research because he worked at gallup. he understood persuasion because he was a spy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="miles-davis">miles davis</a></strong> — didn&#39;t just play jazz. pulled in classical harmonies, rock energy, electronic textures. invented new genres by refusing to stay in one.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">steve jobs 🔒</span></strong>— his calligraphy class influenced typography in the mac. his interest in buddhism influenced his design philosophy — simplicity and minimalism.</p>
<h2>how to practice it</h2>
<ul>
<li>read outside your field</li>
<li>talk to people who do different work</li>
<li>ask &quot;how would X approach this?&quot;</li>
<li>notice patterns that repeat across domains</li>
</ul>
