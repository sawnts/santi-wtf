<h1>thinking in public</h1>
<p>sharing ideas before they&#39;re finished seems counterintuitive, but this is what a <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="digital-garden">digital garden</a> is for — not polished essays, but thoughts in progress. </p>
<h2>why would anyone in their right mind do that?</h2>
<p><strong>accountability</strong> — when ideas are public, you have to tend them. the garden creates healthy pressure to develop your thinking.</p>
<p><strong>feedback</strong> — other people see things you miss. sometimes a stranger&#39;s comment can trigger fresher perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>connection</strong> — you find your people by showing your work. people are naturally attracted to people who share their interests and curiosities.</p>
<p><strong>compounding</strong> — ideas build on ideas. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="linking-is-thinking">linking is thinking</a>. a public archive of your thinking becomes a resource you — and others — can draw from forever.</p>
<h2>the fear is real</h2>
<p>what if it&#39;s wrong? what if it&#39;s dumb? what if someone disagrees?</p>
<p>that&#39;s the point. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="the-map-is-not-the-territory">the map is not the territory</a> — your ideas are maps, not absolute truths. getting them out of your head and into the world is how you refine them.</p>
<p>a digital garden isn&#39;t a stage. you&#39;re not here to perform. you&#39;re here to share what you&#39;re thinking without pressure to be right. dance like no one&#39;s watching.</p>
