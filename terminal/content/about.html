<h1>welcome to my garden. shoes off, please.</h1>
<p>i built this site because i miss the internet. the one before the apps. i miss the weird little corners of the web where people shared their thoughts, art, and creativity freely. the internet before social media algorithms.</p>
<p>i miss that internet.</p>
<p>so i made a little corner of my own to share my thoughts, feelings, and doings. away from all the noise. away from algorithms and ads. just me, my words, and now, you.</p>
<p><strong>a little bit about me:</strong> people call me santi (sawn-tee). i&#39;m obsessed with the creative process, i write here and there, and spend most of my days slinging software. when i&#39;m not working, you&#39;ll catch me reading, vibing, or <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/sawnts">pushing pawns</a></p>
<p><strong>a little bit about this garden:</strong> this is a <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="digital-garden">digital-garden</a> — a collection of interconnected notes, ideas, and thoughts that grow over time. unlike a blog with finished posts, a garden is always evolving.</p>
<h2>how to get around</h2>
<p>use the folder tree on the left to explore by vibe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>thinking</strong> — ideas, questions, learnings</li>
<li><strong>being</strong> — personal notes, updates, reflections</li>
<li><strong>doing</strong> — projects and pursuits</li>
<li><strong>loving</strong> — mostly people and their work, with a hint of random</li>
</ul>
<p>or click any <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="integration">wikilink</a> to follow connections between notes. you can hover over links to preview their content.</p>
<p>notes are marked with growth stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>🌱 <strong>seedling</strong> — early ideas, rough thoughts</li>
<li>🌿 <strong>growing</strong> — developing ideas with some structure</li>
<li>🌲 <strong>evergreen</strong> — well-developed, stable concepts</li>
</ul>
<h2>start exploring</h2>
<p>some good starting points:</p>
