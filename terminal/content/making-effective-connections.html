<h1>making effective connections</h1>
<p>good links are like good friendships. they need shared context to mean something.</p>
<p>linking two notes because they both mention &quot;creativity&quot; is shallow. no different than introducing two people just because they live in new york. </p>
<p>effective connections happen when ideas speak to each other. when one note challenges, extends, or illuminates another. when the link itself carries meaning.</p>
<p>the best connections surprise you. they reveal relationships you didn&#39;t see when you wrote the notes. that&#39;s when the system starts thinking with you.</p>
<p>this is why <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="read-old-notes">rereading old notes</a> matters — your best connections come from revisiting ideas with fresh eyes.</p>
