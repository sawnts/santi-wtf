<h1>thoughts on consistency</h1>
<p>consistency is the unsexy secret behind everything that works.</p>
<p>showing up matters more than showing off. a garden grows one day at a time. so does a body, a skill, a body of work.</p>
<h2>why is being consistent so damn hard?</h2>
<ul>
<li>results lag behind effort (you don&#39;t see progress immediately)</li>
<li>motivation fades faster than discipline builds</li>
<li>life happens — travel, illness, chaos</li>
</ul>
<h2>why it matters</h2>
<p><a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="power-of-writing-online">writing online</a> only works if you keep doing it. <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="digital-garden">tending a garden</a> only works if you tend it. taste only improves if you develop it. the compound effect is real, but it requires consistent reps.</p>
