<h1>my favorite reads 2025</h1>
<p>the first one is 70 pages long. number two will get anybody out of a reading slump. the third one is its sequel. the fourth one is the only personal development book you need. and number 5 is tea.</p>
<p>this year, i must&#39;ve finished no more than 20. a sad number compared to last year&#39;s 50+</p>
<p>but vanity metrics aside, these were my absolute top 5.</p>
<h2>1. the death of ivan ilyich - leo tolstoy</h2>
<p>i read this razor thin book on a flight from portland to seattle and it sliced me wide open. my affairs with russian authors — dostoevsky, nabokov, checkov and now tolstoy — have been nothing short of extraordinary. they make me want more. and the story of dying ivan left me wanting more out of life.</p>
<p><strong>warning:</strong> this book may trigger the existential crisis you&#39;ve been putting off.</p>
<h2>2. red rising - pierce brown</h2>
<p>think &quot;hunger games&quot; meets &quot;game of thrones&quot; in space. this book is fucking dope. the pages turn themselves. you cheer. you curse. you cry. it never slows down. and the social criticism is sick. might be a little too violent for some, but not for me. ten out of ten.</p>
<h2>3. golden son - pierce brown</h2>
<p>i just put this one down. picked it up right after i closed the last one. didn&#39;t even have time to buy a physical copy. pierce brown is my kind of writer. short, unpretentious sentences that pack a punch and pull you into the world and story head-first. is this one better than the first one? yes. think of the first one as the prologue. this is where shit hits the fan.</p>
<p>oh, and i&#39;m reading book III as i type this, in case you were wondering.</p>
<h2>4. the one thing - gary w. keller</h2>
<p>i used to be a self-help junkie. i&#39;ve read 50 out of <a href="https://www.shortform.com/best-books/genre/best-self-help-books-of-all-time">this best 100 list</a>. that should tell you something. i will save my rant about the personal development industry for a future note, but the principle covered in this book and the surrounding strategies and case studies make the dirty looks you&#39;ll get browsing the self-help aisle totally worth it.</p>
<h2>5. the secret history - donna tartt</h2>
<p>i&#39;m ashamed to admit i didn&#39;t know of donna tartt until the nerdy girl at barnes &amp; noble recommended her to me. &quot;if you like [the TV show] succession you&#39;ll like the secret history.&quot; she said, waving the personal copy she kept next to the register. rich white people drama, i thought. she was not wrong. this whole book is tea.</p>
