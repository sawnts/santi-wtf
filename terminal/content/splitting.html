<h1>splitting</h1>
<p>before you can understand something, you often need to break it apart. this is splitting — the analytical complement to <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="integration">integration</a>.</p>
<h2>when to split</h2>
<p>splitting is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>a problem feels overwhelming</li>
<li>you can&#39;t identify the root cause</li>
<li>you need to explain something complex</li>
<li>you want to improve a process</li>
</ul>
<h2>techniques</h2>
<p><strong><span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">first principles 🔒</span></strong> — break down to fundamental truths and rebuild from there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wikilink-private" title="private note">5 whys 🔒</span></strong> — keep asking &quot;why&quot; to drill down to root causes.</p>
<h2>the danger</h2>
<p>pure analysis can miss emergent properties. a song is more than the sum of its notes. after splitting, remember to step back and see the whole again.</p>
