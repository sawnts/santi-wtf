<p>a fan once complained to miles davis after a show: &quot;that new shit you&#39;re into, i just can&#39;t get with it.&quot;</p>
<p>miles clapped back: &quot;should i wait for you?&quot;</p>
<p>you don&#39;t need everyone to get it. you need to keep moving.</p>
<hr>
<p>miles davis told his musicians: &quot;if you learn any of that old shit, you&#39;re fired.&quot;</p>
<p>he was talking about his own celebrated work.</p>
<p>he knew he couldn&#39;t step into the future without letting go of his past.</p>
<p>don&#39;t let your past keep you from stepping into your future.</p>
