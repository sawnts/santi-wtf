<h1>welcome to my garden. shoes off, please.</h1>
<p>i built this site because i miss the internet. the one before the apps. i miss the weird little corners of the web where people shared their thoughts, art, and creativity freely. the internet before social media algorithms.</p>
<p>i miss that internet.</p>
<p>so i made a little corner of my own to share my thoughts, feelings, and doings. away from all the noise. away from algorithms and ads. just me, my words, and now, you.</p>
<p>this is a <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="digital-garden">digital-garden</a> — a collection of interconnected notes, ideas, and thoughts that grow over time. unlike a blog with finished posts, a garden is always evolving.</p>
