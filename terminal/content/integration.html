<h1>integration</h1>
<p>the best ideas often come from combining concepts that don&#39;t obviously belong together. </p>
<p><a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="david-ogilvy">ogilvy</a>&#39;s life is a masterclass of creative cross-pollination. the legendary ad-man cooked at the hotel majestic in paris, sold stoves door-to-door, did research for Gallup, worked as a british intelligence officer, and even farmed tobacco — all before founding his famous ad agency at 38. this eclectic background gave him a deeper understanding of both products and consumers.</p>
<h2>the opposite of splitting</h2>
<p>while <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="splitting">splitting</a> is about breaking things down to understand them, integration is about reassembling them in new ways. both skills are essential.</p>

<h2>how to practice integration</h2>
<ul>
<li>read widely outside your field</li>
<li>look for structural similarities between different domains</li>
<li>ask &quot;what would x think about y?&quot;</li>
<li>combine tools and techniques from unrelated disciplines</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
