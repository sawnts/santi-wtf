<h1>tech no one needs but i can&#39;t live without</h1>
<p>i&#39;m not a gadget person. i don&#39;t chase specs or wait in line for launches. but some things have quietly become pillars in my daily life — tools i&#39;d genuinely mourn if they disappeared or immediately buy again if they broke.</p>
<p>none of this is essential. all of it makes my life measurably better.</p>

<h2>remarkable paper pro</h2>
<p>the joy tech used to give me. remember when new gadgets felt magical instead of exhausting? the reMarkable brought that back.</p>
<p>it solves exactly one problem: writing without distractions. no apps, no notifications, no &quot;just checking one thing&quot; that turns into an hour youtube rabbit hole. i get paper feel + digital convenience. </p>
<p>i use it mainly for personal notes, ideating, and mind-mapping.</p>
<h2>airpods max</h2>
<p>overpriced? absolutely. worth it? 100%.</p>
<p>the noise cancellation is unreal — i put these on and the world goes quiet. the seamless switching between devices means i never think about bluetooth pairing. and the build quality is gorgeous. they feel like an object, not disposable electronics.</p>
<p>i wear them 5+ hours a day. cost per use is probably down to pennies at this point.</p>
<h2>fuji x100vi</h2>
<p>the camera that made me fall in love with photography (again).</p>
<p>powerful enough to shoot professionally. compact enough to actually carry. the fixed 23mm lens forces you to move your feet instead of zooming — which, in my opinion, makes you a better photographer. and it&#39;s genuinely fun to use. the dials, the viewfinder, the film simulations. it feels like a camera should feel.</p>
<p>most phone photos are technically good but emotionally dead. the fuji makes me want to take pictures.</p>
<h2>whoop</h2>
<p>i never got into wearables until i tried whoop and got addicted to the data.</p>
<p>no screen — which means no temptation to check notifications on my wrist. just quiet tracking of sleep, strain, and recovery. the trends over time are what changed my behavior. seeing the correlation between alcohol and terrible sleep. noticing how consistent wake times improve everything. data as a mirror.</p>
<h2>dyson v10</h2>
<p>a vacuum shouldn&#39;t spark joy. and yet.</p>
<p>cordless means i actually use it. the attachments make it easy to clean anything.</p>
<p>i vacuum more now. my apartment is cleaner. and i&#39;m no longer stepping on litter every time i go in the laundry room.</p>
<h2>macbook air m4</h2>
<p>the laptop that proves you don&#39;t need a &quot;pro&quot; machine for most work.</p>
<p>thin, light, silent, all-day battery. enough power to run everything i throw at it. the m4 chip is absurd — my old intel macbook sounds like a jet engine doing the same tasks this handles without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>it&#39;s boring in the best way. it just works.</p>
<h2>g-shock gw-m5610</h2>
<p>the best watch ever made. i&#39;ll die on this hill.</p>
<p>solar powered, atomic time sync, water resistant to depths i&#39;ll never reach. no apps, no notifications, no charging. just tells me the time, accurately, forever.</p>
<p>i wear other watches, but the g-shock is the daily driver.</p>
<h2>breville barista express</h2>
<p>espresso at home without a second mortgage.</p>
<p>beginner-friendly enough that i learned on it. manual enough that i can dial in my shots and feel like i&#39;m actually making something. the built-in grinder means one less device on the counter.</p>
<p>at $8/latte in seattle, this paid for itself in months. now it&#39;s just printing money — one oat milk latte at a time.</p>
<hr>
<h2>the pattern</h2>
<p>i love tools that do one thing well, get out of the way, and make my life better.</p>
<p>no feature bloat. no subscription upsells. no &quot;smart&quot; features that complicate what should be simple. just well-designed objects that solve real problems and let me focus on what matters.</p>
<p>that&#39;s the tech i can&#39;t live without.</p>
