<h1>read old notes</h1>
<p>your past self had ideas your current self forgot. rereading is how you bring them back — under a new light, with fresh eyes, and a heavy dose of curiosity.</p>
<h2>why do it?</h2>
<p>notes decay without attention. an idea captured six months ago might be exactly what you need today, but you won&#39;t find it if you&#39;re only looking forward.</p>
<p>rereading also deepens understanding. you&#39;re not the same person who wrote that note. new experiences, new context, new connections. what seemed obvious then might click differently now. what felt incomplete might suddenly have an ending. this was my experience after reading an old essay i wrote about creativity over a year later. it somehow inspired this <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="digital-garden">gardening project</a></p>
<p>serendipity happens not by accident, but by showing up, consistently, over a long enough timeline.</p>
