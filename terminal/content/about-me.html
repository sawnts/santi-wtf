<h1>whoami?</h1>
<p>people call me santi (sawn-tee). </p>
<p>i&#39;m obsessed with the creative process. i write, take photos, and build shit i like. </p>
<p>i spend my days slinging software and exploring the intersection between creativity, philosophy, and business. when i&#39;m not working, you&#39;ll catch me soaking in art, moving my body, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/sawnts">pushing pawns</a>.</p>
<p>this site is my <a href="#" class="wikilink" data-note="about-this-site">digital garden</a> — my thinking made visible.</p>
